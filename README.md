# Wk2Assessment

Total fail. And I know how to do this. But I choked and couldn't even get the button to work. WTF.

Update: app.js is the original, coded during the assessment time. App2.js is basically just a corrected file, with all points of the assignment completed. Just for my own peace of mind, mostly.
